# GifDownloader
For solving a problem i had at school
<hr>
Ok, so at my school the teachers asked us to create a gif in https://gifmaker.me/
and instead of sending them the downloaded gif, we would give them the link
that you get when you click the option <i>View the Gif</i> (after clicking create GIF animation)
after that, you should get a link like this: https://gifmaker.me/PlayGIFAnimation.php?folder=2020021213JhuR6Dad91RRZomuGg2yBK&file=output_jTnx0A.gif

<b>But the problem is that the GIF expires in 6 hours</b>
and you don't know when the student will send you the gif

so everyone who have send the GIF in a certain period of time, would have to make it again, and send it again
<i>That was me =)</i>

Anyway the gif would be sent to them by a google form like this
> <h2>Yay put your Name</h2>
> <i>Nicolas</i>
> <h2>Put your class</h2>
> <i>some number</i>
> <h2>Put your GIF url</h2>
> <i>the url i showed before</i>

<hr>

So I did a program wich will look into the google forms answers (wich should be stored in a google drive spreadsheet)
get the links
the names and the class
and it will save like this

> some number/Nicolas.gif

#OKAY, NOW THE BIG PART
<h1>I SEND A MESSAGE TO MY TEACHER ON THE LINK FIELD SAYING THAT I DID THIS</h1>
<h1>AND HE SAW IT YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY HE TALKED TO ME AND LIKED A LOT YAY IM SUPER HAPPY</h1>
